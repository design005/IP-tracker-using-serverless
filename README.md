### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Tailwind
-Netlify function server
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
This one was tough.I Learnt how to work with APIs and got to know about responses and ofcourse the backend part to hide the API Key.

### Continued development
The API not giving precise location.So, will work on that and also the layout of search bar which is rendering differently on Iphones.
